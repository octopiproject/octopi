# Octopi
Octopi is a PHP framework for robust applications.
It's obviously incomplete, but it should work for smaller applications as of 2019-08-28.

## Routing
Routing with Octopi is easy with the inbuilt `class` `Route`.  It can be initialized like so:

```php
new Route('[PATH]', '[CONTROLLER FILE NAME]');
```
